## üå± Vision

**Flourish** is an integrated personal growth platform designed to help individuals achieve true prosperity in finance and performance. Based on Scientology management principles, we believe that through proper data tracking and analysis, everyone can find their path to success.

When money flows and statistics rise, everything will **flourish**.

## üì¶ Applications

### Flow üí∞
**Financial Tracking Application**

Flow helps you track and manage finances, letting money flow healthily to create abundance.

**Key Features**:
- Transaction recording (income/expenses)
- Category management
- Budget tracking
- Financial statistics and reports
- Export/import capabilities

**Philosophy**: Money is flow. By tracking and managing financial flow, we create abundance.

### Apex üìà
**Statistics Curve Tracking Tool**

Apex helps you plot statistical curves, track performance peaks, and achieve power condition status.

**Key Features**:
- Statistical data input and visualization
- Condition formula calculation (Scientology management)
- Trend analysis
- Curve plotting
- Integration with Flow data

**Philosophy**: Track the apex (peak) of your statistics. Continuously climb upward to reach power condition.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
- **Framework**: Turborepo
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Workspace**: Multiple apps and shared packages

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI**: React 19, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TBD (React Query / Zustand)

### Backend
- **Framework**: NestJS
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Architecture**: Modular, dependency injection
- **API Style**: RESTful

### Database & Auth
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Strategy**: Frontend handles auth, backend validates JWT

### Shared Packages
- `@repo/database` - Prisma schema and client
- `@repo/chart-engine` - Curve calculation logic
- `@repo/ui` - Shared UI components
- `@repo/eslint-config` - ESLint configuration
- `@repo/typescript-config` - TypeScript configuration

## üé® Design Philosophy

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Frontend: UI rendering, user interaction, state management
- Backend: Business logic, data persistence, authorization
- Authentication: Delegated to Supabase Auth

### 2. Type Safety
- Full TypeScript across frontend and backend
- Shared types between apps
- Prisma generates types from database schema

### 3. Developer Experience
- Hot reload for all apps
- Unified linting and formatting
- Git hooks for quality checks
- Clear documentation

### 4. Specification-Driven Development
- Every feature starts with clear requirements
- Design decisions documented before coding
- Tasks tracked with progress indicators
- All discussions recorded
